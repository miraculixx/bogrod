"critical":
- |
  Add critical notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
  this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
  needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
  available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
  some details.
"deprecations":
- |
  List deprecations notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list
  items in this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so
  the text needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information
  only available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean
  repeating some details.
"features":
- |
  List new features here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
  this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
  needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
  available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
  some details.
"fixes":
- |
  Add normal bug fixes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items
  in this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the
  text needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
  available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
  some details.
"issues":
- |
  List known issues here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
  this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
  needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
  available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
  some details.
"other":
- |
  Add other notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
  this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
  needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
  available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
  some details.
"prelude": |
  Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this release. All of the prelude content is merged together and then rendered separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so the text needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items make sense when read independently. This may mean repeating some details. Not every release note requires a prelude. Usually only notes describing major features or adding release theme details should have a prelude.
"security":
- |
  Add security notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
  this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
  needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
  available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
  some details.
